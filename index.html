				<h1>The Cacophony Project</h1>
				<h2>Making the most of technology trends - Unleashing Moores Law on the Pests</h2>
				<p>
					The riotous cacophony of birdsong was one of the things Captain Cook and Joseph Banks found truly extraordinary when they first arrived in New Zealand”
This Cacophony has been recreated on island and fenced sanctuaries around New Zealand and the aim of The Cacophony Project is to help accelerate that recovery on the mainland.
The book "Paradise Saved" is a remarkable story that shows the effort that has gone into turning the corner on NZ's unique environment. Our aim is to try to stimulate conservation productivity so that this effort can make even bigger impact over time. The two first core strategies we will work on are:
<ul>
  <li>
making the most of technology trends - how to unleash "Moore’s law" on the pests</li>
<li>how to use social media to get more people involved and making useful contributions 
</li>
</ul>

			<h1>Project 1 - Open source sound capture tool to measure health of the environment.</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					Bird volume is a reasonably good proxy for health of the environment and in the long term this could be a very cheap way to monitor the progress of pest eradication projects.


				</p>
				<p>
State of the art measurement of birds quantities and types is very expensive and hard to make accurate given that it is a very labour intensive project (link http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/inventory-monitoring/im-toolbox-birds-introduction-to-monitoring.pdf). 
				</p>

			<div>
				<p>
					Our assumption is that eventually computer analysis of sounds will give an objective measure of state of the environment and how it is changing over time. What ever we record now will be useful for tracking how things change over time. Realitive simple analysis will be useful to know what pest eradication methods are making the most differenc. Over time with the improvement in analysis they may be able to do very sophisticated analysis of bird species and possibly individual birds and pest.  More details on project here….
