				<h1>Project Cacophony </h1>
				<h2>That's what we live for.</h2>
				<p>
					The riotous cacophony of birdsong was one of the things Captain Cook and Joseph Banks found truly extraordinary when they first arrived in New Zealand”
This Cacophony has been recreated on island and fenced sanctuaries around New Zealand and the aim of Project Cacophony is to help accelerate that recovery on the mainland.
The book "Paradise Saved" is a remarkable story that shows the effort that has gone into turning the corner on NZ's unique environment. Our aim is to try to stimulate conservation productivity so that this effort can make even bigger impact over time. The two first core strategies we will work on are:
•	how to unleash "Moore’s law" on the pests - making the most of technology trends
•	how to use social media to get more people involved and making useful contributions

			<h1>Project 1 - Open source sound capture tool to measure health and of environment.</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					Bird volume is a reasonably good proxy for health of the environment and in the long term this could be a very cheap way to monitor the progress of pest eradication projects.
State of the art measurement of birds quantities and types is very expensive and hard to make accurate given that it is a very labour intensive project (link http://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/science-and-technical/inventory-monitoring/im-toolbox-birds-introduction-to-monitoring.pdf). 

				</p>
				<p>
					Our assumption is that eventually computer analysis of sounds will give an objective measure of state of the environment and how it is changing over time. If a cell phone can identify 20,000 different words then eventually you would think it should be able to identify 100 or so birds and pests.  More details on project here….
